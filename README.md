# Image Colourization

Developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline that can automate the task of image colourization using *deep learning* and PyTorch.\
One of the most exciting applications of deep learning is converting *black and white* images into *colourized* images \
Here I have **Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks** to do the job!\
My application of cGAN is highly inspired by the **Pix2Pix** implementation of GANs\
I will explain the steps I took to achieve the goal!!

## Installation
